# Skill: Show Off LinkedIn

## Purpose
Generate a beautiful, screenshot-ready HTML architecture diagram of what the
student built — designed for posting on LinkedIn. Claude analyzes the student's
code, understands their architecture, and generates a custom 1080x1080 visual
in the AI Analyst Lab brand style.

The student does nothing except type `/show-off-linkedin`, confirm the post,
and hit Post on LinkedIn. Claude handles everything else — renders the image,
drafts the caption, opens LinkedIn, and copies the caption to clipboard.

## When to Use
- User says `/show-off-linkedin` or "LinkedIn showcase" or "share on LinkedIn"
- End of Day 1 or Day 2 when students want to share what they built

## Invocation
`/show-off-linkedin` — generate a LinkedIn-ready architecture diagram

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find the Student's Work

Same detection logic as `/show-off`. Do NOT ask the student to explain anything.

1. **Run `git status --short`** to see untracked (`??`) and modified (`M`) files
2. **Run `git diff`** to see what they changed in existing files
3. **Read the new/modified files** to understand what they actually contain

If the student HAS made commits:
4. **Run `git log --oneline --all --not --remotes`** to find local-only commits
5. Combine committed changes with uncommitted work

**Ignore** `.env`, `.gitignore`, `node_modules/`, lockfiles, `__pycache__/`, etc.

**Understand the architecture** — what components exist, how they connect,
what data flows where. Focus on agents, skills, helpers, analysis outputs,
charts, and pipelines. Count things: how many agents, how many charts, how
many tests, how many lines of code they wrote.

### Step 2: Choose a Layout Pattern

Based on what the student built, choose the best layout:

**Pattern A: Engine + Fan-out** (most common)
Use when: Student built a core analysis system that produces multiple outputs.
Structure: Input question → Engine block → Branch to output columns → File tree
Example: "Asked a question → analysis engine → experiment design + charts + deep dives → organized output"

**Pattern B: Linear Pipeline**
Use when: Student built a sequential multi-step pipeline.
Structure: Numbered steps flowing top to bottom, each with a badge (agent/python).
Example: "Data in → clean → analyze → visualize → report out"

**Pattern C: Component Showcase**
Use when: Student built several independent components (agents, skills, helpers)
that don't form a single pipeline.
Structure: Component count chips at top → individual component boxes with details → stats.
Example: "Built 3 agents + 2 helpers + 1 skill, each doing different things"

Most students will fit Pattern A. When in doubt, use Pattern A.

### Step 3: Generate the HTML

Read the design system reference at `references/design-system.html` in this
skill's directory. This file contains:
- All CSS classes and their visual styling
- A complete working example (Pattern A: engine + fan-out)
- Color variants for each component type

**Generate a complete, self-contained HTML file** using the CSS from the design
system. Copy the full `<style>` block from the reference, then write custom HTML
in the `<div class="content">` section for this specific student's build.

#### Available CSS components

**Layout:**
- `.slide` — 1080x1080 container (always use this)
- `.top-bar`, `.grid-bg`, `.glow`, `.brand` — background effects (always include)
- `.content` — padded flex column for all content
- `.section-divider` — subtle gradient line between sections
- `.flow-arrow` — centered `▼` between sections

**Header (always include):**
- `.eyebrow` — "BUILT WITH AI ANALYST LAB"
- `.title` + `.accent` — main headline with amber accent word
- `.subtitle` — one-line description

**Core blocks:**
- `.input-question` — the prompt/question that started the analysis
- `.engine-block` — the hero component (amber double-border, gradient fill)
  - `.engine-label` — uppercase label
  - `.engine-stack` — horizontal row of tool chains
  - `.engine-item` — individual tool chain (`.tool` for names, `.arrow` for →)

**Fan-out/Fan-in:**
- `.branch` container with `.branch-center-in` + `.branch-lines` + `.branch-drop`
- `.output-row` — flex row of output boxes
- Converge: `.converge-lines` + `.converge-drop` + `.converge-center-out`

**Output boxes** (5 color variants):
- `.output-box.agent` — indigo/purple (for AI agents)
- `.output-box.helper` — emerald/green (for Python helpers)
- `.output-box.output` — amber (for charts, reports, deliverables)
- `.output-box.data` — cyan (for data sources, databases)
- `.output-box.skill` — blue (for skills)
- Inside: `.box-label`, `.box-title`, `.box-items` (with `li` and `li.highlight`), `.box-count`

**File tree box:**
- `.file-tree-box` — shows organized output directory structure
- `.file-tree` with `.dir`, `.file`, `.count`, `.check` spans

**Component chips** (Pattern C):
- `.component-row` — horizontal row
- `.component-chip` with variants `.agent`, `.helper`, `.skill`, `.output`
- Inside: `.chip-count` (big number) + `.chip-label` (small label)

**Numbered steps** (Pattern B):
- `.steps-col` — vertical column
- `.step` with variants `.agent-step`, `.python-step`, `.output-step`
- Inside: `.step-node` (number), `.step-content` (`.step-title` + `.step-desc`), `.step-badge`

**Stats row (always include):**
- `.stats-row` with `.stat-item` containing `.stat-dot` + `.stat-text` (with `.num` spans)

#### Design rules

1. **Always 1080x1080.** This is LinkedIn's square format. The `.slide` class handles this.
2. **Tell a story top-to-bottom.** Input at top, output at bottom. The eye follows the flow.
3. **The engine block is the hero.** If they built a core system, give it the `.engine-block` treatment.
4. **Use color to distinguish component types.** Don't make everything amber — use purple for agents, green for helpers, cyan for data.
5. **Include real details.** Don't just say "charts" — list what charts. Don't just say "agent" — say what it does.
6. **Keep it tight but breathable.** Everything must fit in 1080x1080 without scrolling. But don't cram — whitespace makes it professional.
7. **Count things for the stats row.** Agents, charts, tests, lines of code — concrete numbers make it impressive.

### Step 4: Render to PNG

Save the HTML file to the repo root as `showcase.html`, then render it to
a crisp PNG using the render script:

```bash
node scripts/render-showcase.mjs showcase.html showcase.png
```

This produces a 2160x2160 retina PNG (2x scale of 1080x1080) — perfect for
LinkedIn's image quality. The first run installs puppeteer and downloads
Chromium (~280MB), subsequent runs are instant.

Also copy the PNG to the student's Desktop so they can find it easily:

```bash
cp showcase.png ~/Desktop/showcase.png
```

If the render script fails (missing Node.js, Chromium issues), fall back to
opening the HTML in the browser and telling the student to screenshot manually.

### Step 5: Draft the LinkedIn Post

This is NOT a description. It's a LinkedIn post designed to stop the scroll,
tell a story, and drive engagement. Follow this structure:

#### Structure

1. **Hook (line 1-2):** The surprising, specific, concrete thing. Lead with
   the RESULT, not "I went to a bootcamp." This is what makes people stop
   scrolling. Short. Punchy. Something that makes someone think "wait, what?"

2. **The story (3-5 lines):** What they built, with specific details. What
   question they asked. What it came back with. How fast it was. Make the
   reader feel the moment.

3. **The twist (1-2 lines):** The part that makes it relatable and surprising.
   Their background, the contrast, the "I can't believe this is possible" beat.
   This is the most shareable part.

4. **CTA (last line):** Drive engagement. "Want to learn how to build this?
   Comment below." or "Drop a comment if you want to see how it works." This
   turns views into comments which drives LinkedIn's algorithm.

#### Rules

- First line must work on its own — it's the only thing people see before "...see more"
- No hashtags. No emojis. No "Day 1/30" formatting. No "I'm thrilled to announce"
- Write in their voice — casual, real, like they're texting a friend about something cool
- Include at least one specific number (18 charts, 3 agents, 4 hours, 50K rows)
- Mention **AI Analyst Lab** naturally — not as an ad, but as where it happened
- End with a question or CTA that invites comments

#### Example posts (for pattern, don't copy verbatim):

```
I asked one question. My AI analyst came back with 18 charts and a full
experiment design.

Built this today at the AI Analyst Lab bootcamp. Typed "should we redesign
mobile checkout?" and watched three AI agents coordinate — one queried the
data, one ran the stats, one made the visualizations.

Power analysis. Sample size calculations. Publication-ready charts. All of it.

I'm a PM. I've never written a line of Python.

Want to learn how to build this? Comment below.
```

```
4 hours ago I didn't know what an "agentic pipeline" was.

Now I have one that takes any business question, queries real data with
DuckDB, runs statistical analysis, and outputs organized charts and reports.

Built it at the AI Analyst Lab bootcamp with Claude Code. I designed the
architecture. Claude wrote the code. We went back and forth like pair
programming with someone who never gets tired.

The craziest part? The whole thing runs again on any new question. It's
not a one-off analysis — it's a system.

Want to see how it works? Drop a comment.
```

```
This AI analyst found a pattern my team missed for 6 months.

Weekend mobile checkout drop-off. It was right there in the data. We just
never cut it that way.

Today at the AI Analyst Lab bootcamp I built a pipeline that asks a question,
queries 50K rows of transaction data, and comes back with root cause analysis
+ experiment designs. Took 3 agents and about 4 hours to build.

Already sent the findings to my team. On a Saturday.

Learning how to build AI tools that actually do your job > learning how to
write prompts. If you want to know more, comment and I'll share what I learned.

### Step 6: Confirm Before Posting

Show the student:
1. The rendered PNG (open it: `open showcase.png`)
2. The LinkedIn caption

Ask: **"Here's your LinkedIn showcase and caption. Want me to open LinkedIn
so you can post it, or change anything first?"**

Do NOT proceed until they confirm.

### Step 7: Open LinkedIn with Caption Pre-filled + Image on Clipboard

Two things happen simultaneously:

1. **Caption goes in the URL** — LinkedIn's `shareActive` parameter pre-fills the compose box
2. **Image goes on the clipboard** — macOS `osascript` copies the PNG so the student can Cmd+V

```bash
python3 -c "
import urllib.parse, subprocess, webbrowser, os

caption = '''CAPTION_TEXT_HERE'''

# Copy the PNG to clipboard (macOS)
png_path = os.path.abspath('showcase.png')
subprocess.run(['osascript', '-e', 'set the clipboard to (read (POSIX file \"' + png_path + '\") as «class PNGf»)'])

# Open LinkedIn with caption pre-filled
url = 'https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?shareActive=true&text=' + urllib.parse.quote(caption)
webbrowser.open(url)
"
```

LinkedIn opens with the compose box active and the caption already typed in.
The showcase PNG is on the clipboard ready to paste.

Then tell the student:

**"LinkedIn is open with your caption already filled in and your image
copied to your clipboard. Just hit Cmd+V to paste the image, then Post!"**

One paste, one click.

**Fallback:** If pasting the image doesn't work in LinkedIn's composer (some
browsers handle clipboard images differently), tell the student to click the
image icon in the composer and select `showcase.png` from their project folder.

### Step 8: Clean up

After they've posted (or decided not to), the `showcase.html` and
`showcase.png` files can be deleted — they're not part of the project:

```bash
rm -f showcase.html showcase.png
```

Don't auto-delete — ask first or just mention they can clean up.

## Rules
1. The student should NOT have to explain what they built — Claude figures it out
2. Every showcase must be exactly 1080x1080 pixels
3. Copy the FULL CSS from the design system reference — don't write custom CSS
4. Only customize the HTML structure inside `.content`
5. Always include: header, main architecture section, stats row, brand watermark
6. Use real data from the student's code — never make up file names or counts
7. The visual should look like a product launch page, not a homework assignment
