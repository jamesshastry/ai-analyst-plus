| Chart Maker | `agents/chart-maker.md` | Need to generate a specific chart. |
| Visual Design Critic | `agents/visual-design-critic.md` | After Chart Maker generates charts — reviews against SWD checklist. After Deck Creator — reviews slide-level design with `{{DECK_FILE}}` and `{{THEME}}`. |
| Narrative Coherence Reviewer | `agents/narrative-coherence-reviewer.md` | After Story Architect produces the storyboard, before charting — reviews story flow, beat structure, and Closing beats if present |
| Storytelling | `agents/storytelling.md` | Analysis and charts are complete, need a narrative |
| Cross-Verification | `agents/cross-verification.md` | After analysis (step 6.5) — verify analytical claims via independent calculation paths (Types A-D: boundary, parts-to-whole, ratio recompute, algebraic identity). Includes reproducibility checks. |
| Receipt Generator | `agents/receipt-generator.md` | After close-the-loop (step 18.5, conditional) — full audit trail for Reproduce audience. Query log, validation, cross-verification, reproducibility. Tier 3 or `/export receipt`. |
| Notion Export | `agents/notion-export.md` | Export analysis to Notion page with charts, data stamps, provenance toggles, Analysis Gallery integration. Standalone, invoked via `/export notion`. |
| Validation | `agents/validation.md` | Need to verify findings before presenting |
| Deck Creator | `agents/deck-creator.md` | Need to create a presentation from analysis. Supports `{{THEME}}` (analytics-dark) and `{{CONTEXT}}` (workshop/talk closing sequence). |
| Comms Drafter | `agents/comms-drafter.md` | Need stakeholder communications (Slack summary, email brief, exec summary). Non-critical — pipeline continues if this fails. |
| Google Slides Creator | `agents/google-slides-creator.md` | Need a live, editable Google Slides deck (alternative to Deck Creator). Uses `{{NARRATIVE}}`, `{{STORYBOARD}}`, optional `{{THEME}}` (light/dark) and `{{DECK_TITLE}}`. Requires Google Workspace MCP. |
| Google Slides Reviewer | `agents/google-slides-reviewer.md` | Auto-invoked after Google Slides Creator -- reviews formatting (overflow, overlap, fonts, colors) and self-applies fixes. Max 2 iterations. |
| Google Doc Creator | `agents/google-doc-creator.md` | Need a live, editable Google Doc from analysis narrative + charts. Handles image placement (bottom-to-top), heading hierarchy, and formatting. Requires Google Workspace MCP. |
| Google Doc Reviewer | `agents/google-doc-reviewer.md` | Auto-invoked after Google Doc Creator -- reviews heading hierarchy, image placement, spacing, formatting. Self-applies fixes. Max 2 iterations. |
| Experiment Analyzer | `agents/experiment-analyzer.md` | Full experiment analysis — 8-question framework: SRM → treatment effect → reliability → segments → duration → ROI → recommendation → follow-ups. Takes raw experiment data, produces nuanced conditional recommendation. |
| Experiment Readout | `agents/experiment-readout.md` | Transform experiment analysis into stakeholder-ready readout with executive summary, visualizations, per-segment decisions, ramp plan, and follow-up experiments. Adapts to audience (executive/technical/cross-functional). |
| Story Extractor | `agents/story-extractor.md` | Find the 1-3 stories worth telling in messy input (analysis docs, data tables, bad decks). Scores findings on surprise, impact, relevance, evidence strength. The "editorial judgment" agent. |
| Presentation Doctor | `agents/presentation-doctor.md` | Orchestrator: diagnose → extract → transform. Coordinates deck-critique, story-extractor, and deck-rescue/slide-transform into one pipeline. Includes presenter coaching notes. |
| Hypothesis Sharpener | `agents/hypothesis-sharpener.md` | Takes a vague hunch and transforms it into a testable hypothesis with precise metrics, comparison groups, natural experiments, and accept/reject criteria. Called by `/analysis-design` skill. |
| Confound Scanner | `agents/confound-scanner.md` | Adversarial agent that finds threats to validity — concurrent changes, data quality issues, selection biases. Argues AGAINST the hypothesis to make the investigation airtight. Called by `/analysis-design` skill. |
| Feedback Synthesizer | `agents/feedback-synthesizer.md` | Takes V1 findings + messy stakeholder feedback, categorizes it (methodological flaws, missing confounds, reframes, new analyses), and produces a structured V2 investigation plan with stakeholder answer map. Called by `/analysis-design` skill. |
| Demo Breakout | `agents/demo-breakout.md` | Guided breakout room experience -- interviews the student with 5 creative questions, then walks them through a personalized 5-stage analytical pipeline (Frame, Analyze, Story, Deck, Share) with pause points between each stage. Invoked by `/demo`. |
| Experiment Interpreter | `agents/experiment-interpreter.md` | Walks the Result Interpretation Tree (positive/null/negative/mixed) and applies EwL framework (Ship/Abort/Learn/Invalid). Called by `/experiment interpret`. |
| Experiment Monitor | `agents/experiment-monitor.md` | Daily monitoring: SRM trending, guardrail status, sample accumulation, power projection. Called by `/experiment monitor`. |
| Causal Method Selector | `agents/causal-method-selector.md` | Interactive 8-question decision tree to recommend the right causal method (DiD, PSM, pre-post, regression). Called by `/causal select`. |

| Causal Sensitivity | `agents/causal-sensitivity.md` | Rosenbaum bounds, E-value, placebo tests with plain-language translations. Called by `/causal sensitivity`. |
| Causal Interpreter | `agents/causal-interpreter.md` | Places estimate on the confidence ladder and synthesizes verdicts. Called by `/causal report`. |
| Causal Report Generator | `agents/causal-report-generator.md` | Full report with mandatory caveats per method (non-negotiable). Called by `/causal report`. |
