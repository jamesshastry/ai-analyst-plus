# Codex Skills Index

Codex-native skills live under `.agents/skills/`. These skills complement, but do not fully
replace, legacy Claude Code skills under `.claude/skills/`.

| `experiment` | `.agents/skills/experiment/SKILL.md` | The user wants to design, power, monitor, analyze, interpret, or report on an experiment or A/B test. | `experiments/{slug}/` |
| `run-pipeline` | `.agents/skills/run-pipeline/SKILL.md` | The user wants an end-to-end multi-phase analysis workflow, validated narrative, charts, and deck/export artifacts. | `working/runs/{run}/`, `outputs/` |
| `resume-pipeline` | `.agents/skills/resume-pipeline/SKILL.md` | The user wants to continue, recover, or finish an interrupted pipeline run. | `working/latest/pipeline_state.json`, `working/runs/` |
| `export` | `.agents/skills/export/SKILL.md` | The user wants to export/share/send analysis results as slides, email, Slack, brief, data, docx, Google Doc, Notion, or receipt. | `outputs/` |
| `presentation-themes` | `.agents/skills/presentation-themes/SKILL.md` | The user is creating or reviewing stakeholder decks, Marp slides, theme selection, slide components, or speaker notes. | `themes/`, `templates/deck_skeleton.marp.md`, `templates/marp_components.md` |
| `session-handoff` | `.agents/skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md` | The user wants to save progress, pause, preserve external IDs, or continue later. | `working/session_state.yaml` |
| `google-doc-export` | `.agents/skills/google-doc-export/SKILL.md` | The user wants a Google Doc export or formatted analysis doc with local docx backup. | `outputs/*.docx`, `outputs/gdoc_export.yaml`, `working/session_state.yaml` |
| `google-slides-export` | `.agents/skills/google-slides-export/SKILL.md` | The user wants a Google Slides export or shareable online deck. | Google Slides URL/ID, `working/session_state.yaml` |

| `independent-review` | `.agents/skills/independent-review/SKILL.md` | The user wants a provider-neutral blind second-pass validation, second opinion, cross-check, or independent re-derivation. | `working/independent_review/`, `.knowledge/independent-review/log.jsonl` |
| `claude-review` | `.agents/skills/claude-review/SKILL.md` | Codex produced an analysis and the user wants Claude to independently validate it from a blind brief. | `working/claude_review/`, `.knowledge/claude-review/log.jsonl` |
| `skill-parity-review` | `.agents/skills/skill-parity-review/SKILL.md` | The user wants to compare a Codex skill with its corresponding Claude skill, audit migration parity, port a Claude skill to Codex, or bring a Codex skill up to parity. | `working/skill_parity_review/` |
| `patterns` | `.agents/skills/patterns/SKILL.md` | User asks what recurring patterns have been seen or whether a finding is known. | `.knowledge/analyses/_patterns.yaml` |
| `history` | `.agents/skills/history/SKILL.md` | User wants archived analysis history, prior findings, or similar past work. | `.knowledge/analyses/index.yaml` |
| `metrics` | `.agents/skills/metrics/SKILL.md` | User wants to browse, search, list, or explain metric definitions. | `.knowledge/datasets/{active}/metrics/` |

## Invocation

Codex skills are not slash commands. Invoke them with natural language or `$skill-name`, for example:

```text
Use $connect-data to add a CSV directory.
Use $datasets to list connected data sources.
Use $switch-dataset production-analytics to change the active dataset.
Use $data-inspect to inspect the active schema.
Use $data-quality-check orders before analyzing the orders table.
Use $metric-spec to define checkout conversion rate.
Use $reliability "What is our 30-day retention rate?" 5 to check answer stability.
Use $compare "What's our retention rate?" --with .knowledge/comparisons/conditions/c1_retention_contract.
Use $experiment analyze checkout-redesign to analyze an A/B test.
Use $run-pipeline question="Why did conversion drop?" to run the full workflow.
Use $resume-pipeline to continue an interrupted run.
Use $export brief to create a stakeholder decision brief.
Use $presentation-themes when creating a Marp deck.
Use $session-handoff after creating an external Doc, Slide deck, or Notion page.
Use $google-doc-export to create a formatted Google Doc with local backup.
Use $google-slides-export to create a Google Slides deck when tools are available.
Use $notion-export to publish analysis to Notion when tools are available.
Use $skill-parity-review to port another Claude skill to Codex.
Use $patterns to search recurring findings.
Use $history to browse archived analyses.
Use $metrics to list metric definitions for the active dataset.
```

Do not use underscore slash commands such as `/skill_parity_review`; Codex treats those as unsupported built-in commands.

## Legacy Claude compatibility

- Legacy Claude skills remain under `.claude/skills/`.
- Legacy Claude `/codex-review` remains at `.claude/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`.
- Codex users should prefer `$independent-review` for provider-neutral validation and
  `$claude-review` when Claude should validate a Codex result.
