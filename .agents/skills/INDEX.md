# Codex Skills Index

Do not use underscore slash commands such as `/skill_parity_review`; Codex treats those as unsupported built-in commands.

## Legacy Claude compatibility

- Legacy Claude skills remain under `.claude/skills/`.
- Legacy Claude `/codex-review` remains at `.claude/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`.
- Codex users should prefer `$independent-review` for provider-neutral validation and
  `$claude-review` when Claude should validate a Codex result.
