## Invocation

Codex skills are not slash commands. Invoke them with natural language or `$skill-name`, for example:

```text
Use $connect-data to add a CSV directory.
Use $datasets to list connected data sources.
Use $switch-dataset production-analytics to change the active dataset.
Use $data-inspect to inspect the active schema.
Use $data-quality-check orders before analyzing the orders table.
Use $metric-spec to define checkout conversion rate.
Use $reliability "What is our 30-day retention rate?" 5 to check answer stability.
Use $compare "What's our retention rate?" --with .knowledge/comparisons/conditions/c1_retention_contract.
Use $experiment analyze checkout-redesign to analyze an A/B test.
Use $run-pipeline question="Why did conversion drop?" to run the full workflow.
Use $resume-pipeline to continue an interrupted run.
Use $export brief to create a stakeholder decision brief.
Use $presentation-themes when creating a Marp deck.
Use $session-handoff after creating an external Doc, Slide deck, or Notion page.
Use $google-doc-export to create a formatted Google Doc with local backup.
Use $google-slides-export to create a Google Slides deck when tools are available.
Use $notion-export to publish analysis to Notion when tools are available.
Use $skill-parity-review to port another Claude skill to Codex.
Use $data-profiling to profile a table before analysis.
Use $compare-datasets to compare behavior across datasets.
Use $question-framing to scope an ambiguous analytics question.
Use $stakeholder-communication to tailor findings for leadership.
Use $srm-check before analyzing experiment effects.
Use $guardrails before presenting a metric lift as a win.
Use $forecast to project a time-series metric.
Use $teach signal-vs-noise to generate a teaching visual.
Use $theme-picker to choose a chart theme.
Use $pace narrated to change workflow narration.
Use $trace to render SQL provenance for reported numbers.
Use $runs to inspect pipeline run history.
Use $patterns to search recurring findings.
Use $history to browse archived analyses.
Use $metrics to list metric definitions for the active dataset.
```

Do not use underscore slash commands such as `/skill_parity_review`; Codex treats those as unsupported built-in commands.

## Legacy Claude compatibility

- Legacy Claude skills remain under `.claude/skills/`.
- Legacy Claude `/codex-review` remains at `.claude/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`.
- Codex users should prefer `$independent-review` for provider-neutral validation and
  `$claude-review` when Claude should validate a Codex result.
