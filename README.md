## What This Is

AI Analyst Plus turns AI coding agents into a product analytics system. It combines:

- **Claude skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — standards Claude follows automatically (chart styling, data validation, question framing, stakeholder communication)
- **Codex skills** (`.agents/skills/`) — Codex-native workflows such as `$independent-review`, `$claude-review`, `$skill-parity-review`, and `$metric-spec`
- **Agents** (`agents/`) — multi-step analytical workflows orchestrated by a DAG engine (question framing → data exploration → analysis → storytelling → deck creation)
- **Helpers** (`helpers/`) — Python modules for charting, SQL validation, data connectivity, statistical tests, and more
- **Knowledge** (`.knowledge/`) — persistent memory for dataset context, corrections, proven SQL patterns, and business glossary

You interact by talking to Claude or Codex. Ask a question, invoke a slash command or skill, or let the agent figure out which skills and agents to apply.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-analyst-lab/ai-analyst-plus.git
cd ai-analyst-plus
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Claude Code path

```bash
claude
```

Then use legacy slash-command workflows, for example:

```text
/connect-data
/run-pipeline question="Why is conversion dropping on mobile?"
/export brief
```

### Codex path

Start Codex in this repository and use natural language or `$skill-name` workflows:

```text
Use $connect-data to add my CSV directory.
Use $datasets to list connected data sources.
Use $data-inspect to inspect the active schema.
Use $run-pipeline question="Why is conversion dropping on mobile?".
Use $export brief to create a stakeholder decision brief.
```

Codex skills are not underscore slash commands. See `docs/codex-guide.md` and
`.agents/skills/INDEX.md` for the current Codex-native workflow list.

### Connect your data

Claude users can run `/connect-data`; Codex users can use `$connect-data`. Supported sources
include CSV, DuckDB/MotherDuck, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and Snowflake. Curated public datasets
with guides live in `data/examples/`.

---

## Don't Know What to Do? Just Ask.

Claude/Codex can inspect the system — every agent, skill, command, and dataset. If you're stuck:

```
What can I do with this data?
What should I run to refresh the deck?
How do I connect my own CSV files?
Which agents handle root cause analysis?
Re-run just the chart maker and deck creator.
```

You don't need to memorize anything in this README. Think of it as a reference — the agent is the guide.

---

## Five Things You Can Do

### 1. Ask a quick question

```
What's our conversion rate by device?
```

Claude queries the data and returns an answer with a chart. Simple questions get answered in under 2 minutes without running the full pipeline.

### 2. Run a full analysis

```
/run-pipeline question="What's driving the decline in conversion?"
```

The pipeline runs 18 agents across 4 phases: Frame the question, Analyze the data, Build the story, Create the deck. You get a validated analysis, branded charts, a narrative, and a slide deck with speaker notes. Exports to PDF, HTML, and Google Docs.

### 3. Explore a dataset

```
/explore
```

Interactive data browsing without committing to a full analysis. Preview tables, check distributions, spot patterns, form hypotheses.

### 4. Connect your own data

```
/connect-data
```

Guided wizard for CSV files, local DuckDB, Postgres, BigQuery, or Snowflake. Auto-profiles your data, creates schema docs, and remembers context across sessions.

### 5. Make a single chart

```
Make a funnel chart of the checkout flow, highlighting the biggest drop-off step.
```

Charts follow Storytelling with Data methodology: warm off-white background, decluttered axes, action title, direct labels instead of legends.

## How It Works: The Pipeline

When you run `/run-pipeline` in Claude Code or `$run-pipeline` in Codex, the agent orchestrates
the registry-backed pipeline across 4 phases:

```
1. FRAME              2. ANALYZE                          3. STORY                 4. DECK
+-----------------+   +-----------------------------+   +--------------------+   +------------------+
| Question        |   | Data Explorer               |   | Story Architect    |   | Storytelling     |
|   Framing       |   |   > Source Tie-Out           |   |   > Coherence      |   |   > Deck Creator |
|   > Hypothesis  |   |   > Descriptive Analytics    |   |     Reviewer       |   |   > Slide Review |
|     Generation  |   |   > Root Cause Investigator  |   |   > Chart Maker    |   |   > Close the    |
|                 |-->|   > Validation               |-->|   > Design Critic  |-->|     Loop         |
+-----------------+   |   > Opportunity Sizer        |   +--------------------+   +------------------+
                      +-----------------------------+
```

**Phase 1 — Frame:** Structures your business question into analytical questions with testable hypotheses.

**Phase 2 — Analyze:** Explores the data, verifies loading integrity, runs segmentation/funnel/drivers analysis, drills to root cause, validates findings, and sizes the opportunity.

**Phase 3 — Story:** Designs a storyboard (Context-Tension-Resolution arc), generates charts with collision detection, and reviews visual quality.

**Phase 4 — Deck:** Writes a stakeholder narrative, builds a branded Marp slide deck, reviews design, and ensures every recommendation has a follow-up plan. Exports to PDF, HTML, and Google Docs.

Five execution plans let you run just the part you need:

| Plan | Use When | What Runs |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `full_presentation` | Complete analysis to slide deck | All 18 agents |
| `deep_dive` | Analysis without presentation | Phases 1-2 only |
| `quick_chart` | Just need one chart | Chart Maker + Design Critic |
| `refresh_deck` | Re-do the presentation layer | Phases 3-4 (reuses analysis) |
| `validate_only` | Check existing work | Validation + Source Tie-Out |

```
/run-pipeline question="..." plan=deep_dive
```

If the pipeline gets interrupted, resume where you left off:

```text
/resume-pipeline      # Claude Code
$resume-pipeline      # Codex
```

## Codex Skill Highlights

Codex-native skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Current high-value workflows include:

| Codex skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `$connect-data`, `$datasets`, `$switch-dataset`, `$data-inspect` | Dataset setup and navigation |
| `$data-quality-check`, `$metric-spec`, `$reliability`, `$compare`, `$experiment` | Analysis quality, metrics, experiments, stability checks |
| `$run-pipeline`, `$resume-pipeline`, `$export` | End-to-end workflow, recovery, deliverables |
| `$presentation-themes`, `$google-doc-export`, `$google-slides-export`, `$notion-export` | Presentation and external export standards |
| `$independent-review`, `$claude-review` | Blind validation and second opinions |
| `$skill-parity-review` | Port or audit additional skills |

See `docs/internal/skill-migration-matrix.md` for migration status and known limitations.

## Test Commands

```bash
pytest
pytest -m "not slow"
pytest tests/test_codex_skills.py
pytest tests/e2e -m "not external"
```

External integrations such as Google Docs, Google Slides, Notion, live warehouses, and Marp
PDF/HTML export require separate tool/auth setup and should be tested with explicit external
markers or manual smoke tests.

## Your Data

This repo ships clean — no bundled datasets. Connect your own data and the system builds context around it.

### Connect your own

Run `/connect-data` for a guided wizard, or `/setup` for full onboarding. Supported sources:

- **CSV files** — drop them in a directory, point Claude at it
- **DuckDB** — local or MotherDuck
- **Postgres** — any Postgres-compatible database
- **BigQuery** — Google BigQuery with service account
- **Snowflake** — Snowflake with user/password or key pair

The system auto-profiles your data, creates schema documentation, and remembers context across sessions in `.knowledge/datasets/`.

### Sample data

Bring your own data via `/connect-data` (DuckDB, Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, or
a CSV directory). Curated public datasets with README guides are available in `data/examples/`.

```

### Skills vs Agents

**Skills** are reusable standards and workflows. Claude skills in `.claude/skills/` support legacy Claude Code slash commands such as `/codex-review`; Codex skills in `.agents/skills/` support Codex-native invocation such as `$independent-review`, `$claude-review`, `$skill-parity-review`, `$metric-spec`, or selection from `/skills`; do not invoke them as underscore slash commands. When you make a chart, the Visualization Patterns skill activates. When you start an analysis, Data Quality Check runs. Multiple skills can fire at once.

**Agents** are multi-step workflows for specific tasks. They're markdown prompt templates with `{{VARIABLES}}` that get substituted at runtime. The pipeline orchestrates them in dependency order using a DAG engine.

### Knowledge System

`.knowledge/` persists across sessions:
- **Dataset context** — schema, quirks, connection details per dataset
- **Corrections** — logged mistakes so the same SQL error never happens twice
- **Query archaeology** — proven SQL patterns retrieved before writing new queries
- **Business glossary** — organization-specific terms, metrics, products, teams (importable from Notion)
