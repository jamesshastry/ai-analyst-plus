## What This Is

AI Analyst Plus turns Claude Code into a product analytics system. It combines:

- **Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — standards Claude follows automatically (chart styling, data validation, question framing, stakeholder communication)
- **Agents** (`agents/`) — multi-step analytical workflows orchestrated by a DAG engine (question framing → data exploration → analysis → storytelling → deck creation)
- **Helpers** (`helpers/`) — Python modules for charting, SQL validation, data connectivity, statistical tests, and more
- **Knowledge** (`.knowledge/`) — persistent memory for dataset context, corrections, proven SQL patterns, and business glossary

You interact by talking to Claude. Ask a question, invoke a slash command, or let Claude figure out which skills and agents to apply.

## Quick Start

**1. Clone and install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-analyst-lab/ai-analyst-plus.git
cd ai-analyst-plus
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**2. Generate sample data** (optional — you can connect your own)

```bash
pip install -r data-generation/requirements.txt
python data-generation/generate.py
```

**3. Start Claude Code**

```bash
claude
```

**4. Ask a question**

```
What's our conversion rate by device?
```

Or run the full pipeline:

```
/run-pipeline question="Why is conversion dropping on mobile?"
```

---

## Don't Know What to Do? Just Ask.

Claude knows the entire system — every agent, skill, command, and dataset. If you're stuck:

```
What can I do with this data?
What should I run to refresh the deck?
How do I connect my own CSV files?
Which agents handle root cause analysis?
Re-run just the chart maker and deck creator.
```

You don't need to memorize anything in this README. Think of it as a reference — Claude is the guide.

---

## Five Things You Can Do

### 1. Ask a quick question

```
What's our conversion rate by device?
```

Claude queries the data and returns an answer with a chart. Simple questions get answered in under 2 minutes without running the full pipeline.

### 2. Run a full analysis

```
/run-pipeline question="What's driving the decline in conversion?"
```

The pipeline runs 18 agents across 4 phases: Frame the question, Analyze the data, Build the story, Create the deck. You get a validated analysis, branded charts, a narrative, and a slide deck with speaker notes. Exports to PDF, HTML, and Google Docs.

### 3. Explore a dataset

```
/explore
```

Interactive data browsing without committing to a full analysis. Preview tables, check distributions, spot patterns, form hypotheses.

### 4. Connect your own data

```
/connect-data
```

Guided wizard for CSV files, local DuckDB, Postgres, BigQuery, or Snowflake. Auto-profiles your data, creates schema docs, and remembers context across sessions.

### 5. Make a single chart

```
Make a funnel chart of the checkout flow, highlighting the biggest drop-off step.
```

Charts follow Storytelling with Data methodology: warm off-white background, decluttered axes, action title, direct labels instead of legends.

## How It Works: The Pipeline

When you run `/run-pipeline`, Claude orchestrates 18 agents across 4 phases:

```
1. FRAME              2. ANALYZE                          3. STORY                 4. DECK
+-----------------+   +-----------------------------+   +--------------------+   +------------------+
| Question        |   | Data Explorer               |   | Story Architect    |   | Storytelling     |
|   Framing       |   |   > Source Tie-Out           |   |   > Coherence      |   |   > Deck Creator |
|   > Hypothesis  |   |   > Descriptive Analytics    |   |     Reviewer       |   |   > Slide Review |
|     Generation  |   |   > Root Cause Investigator  |   |   > Chart Maker    |   |   > Close the    |
|                 |-->|   > Validation               |-->|   > Design Critic  |-->|     Loop         |
+-----------------+   |   > Opportunity Sizer        |   +--------------------+   +------------------+
                      +-----------------------------+
```

**Phase 1 — Frame:** Structures your business question into analytical questions with testable hypotheses.

**Phase 2 — Analyze:** Explores the data, verifies loading integrity, runs segmentation/funnel/drivers analysis, drills to root cause, validates findings, and sizes the opportunity.

**Phase 3 — Story:** Designs a storyboard (Context-Tension-Resolution arc), generates charts with collision detection, and reviews visual quality.

**Phase 4 — Deck:** Writes a stakeholder narrative, builds a branded Marp slide deck, reviews design, and ensures every recommendation has a follow-up plan. Exports to PDF, HTML, and Google Docs.

Five execution plans let you run just the part you need:

| Plan | Use When | What Runs |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `full_presentation` | Complete analysis to slide deck | All 18 agents |
| `deep_dive` | Analysis without presentation | Phases 1-2 only |
| `quick_chart` | Just need one chart | Chart Maker + Design Critic |
| `refresh_deck` | Re-do the presentation layer | Phases 3-4 (reuses analysis) |
| `validate_only` | Check existing work | Validation + Source Tie-Out |

```
/run-pipeline question="..." plan=deep_dive
```

If the pipeline gets interrupted, resume where you left off:

```
/resume-pipeline
```

## Your Data

This repo ships clean — no bundled datasets. Connect your own data and the system builds context around it.

### Connect your own

Run `/connect-data` for a guided wizard, or `/setup` for full onboarding. Supported sources:

- **CSV files** — drop them in a directory, point Claude at it
- **DuckDB** — local or MotherDuck
- **Postgres** — any Postgres-compatible database
- **BigQuery** — Google BigQuery with service account
- **Snowflake** — Snowflake with user/password or key pair

The system auto-profiles your data, creates schema documentation, and remembers context across sessions in `.knowledge/datasets/`.

### Sample data

Generate a synthetic e-commerce dataset for practice:

```bash
python data-generation/generate.py
```

Or bring your own. Curated public datasets with README guides are available in `data/examples/`.

### Skills vs Agents

**Skills** are standards Claude follows automatically. When you make a chart, the Visualization Patterns skill activates. When you start an analysis, Data Quality Check runs. You never invoke them — they apply when their trigger condition matches. Multiple skills can fire at once.

**Agents** are multi-step workflows for specific tasks. They're markdown prompt templates with `{{VARIABLES}}` that get substituted at runtime. The pipeline orchestrates them in dependency order using a DAG engine.

### Knowledge System

`.knowledge/` persists across sessions:
- **Dataset context** — schema, quirks, connection details per dataset
- **Corrections** — logged mistakes so the same SQL error never happens twice
- **Query archaeology** — proven SQL patterns retrieved before writing new queries
- **Business glossary** — organization-specific terms, metrics, products, teams (importable from Notion)
