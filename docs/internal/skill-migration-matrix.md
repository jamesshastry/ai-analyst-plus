# Skill Migration Matrix

Tracks migration from legacy Claude skills in `.claude/skills/` to Codex-native skills in
`.agents/skills/`. Compatibility means equivalent intent, safety, artifacts, and user-facing
outcomes, not copy-paste prompt parity.

## Recommended next steps

All same-name Claude skills currently have Codex-native wrappers. Recommended follow-up work:

1. Run `$skill-parity-review` on high-risk external integration skills with live tools/auth.
2. Extract additional provider-neutral shared standards for large duplicated workflows.
3. Add integration tests for Google, Notion, Snowflake, eval, and community-posting workflows where credentials are available.
